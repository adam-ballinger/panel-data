## ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§
This module is currently under active development, and I am working hard to roll out new features in the coming weeks.

Find Details on what to expect on GitHub [issues](https://github.com/adam-ballinger/panel-data/issues) and [Wiki](https://github.com/adam-ballinger/panel-data/wiki)

Stay tuned for updates and thank you for your patience and support as I continue to improve this package.

## Overview
panel-data provides a PanelData object designed to store and manage panel-data style data. It supports efficient manipulation and analysis of time-series cross-sectional datasets, commonly used in supply chain management, logistics, and other domains requiring structured, row or column-oriented data handling.

## Installation
```bash
npm install panel-data
```

## Example Usage

Right now, you can use the `PanelData` and `Series` classes to store and manipulate data in a format similar to `pandas` DataFrames and Series in Python.

```javascript
const PanelData = require('./panel-data');
const Series = require('./series');

// Create a few Series objects
const observations = new Series([7, 6, 8, 7], { name: 'Observations', index: [1, 2, 3, 4] });
const day = new Series(['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday'], { name: 'Day', index: [1, 2, 3, 4] });
const conditionsMet = new Series([true, true, false, true], { name: 'Conditions Met', index: [1, 2, 3, 4] });

// Create a PanelData object from an array of Series objects
const panelData = new PanelData([observations, day, conditionsMet]);

// Access some useful information
console.log(panelData.columns); // ['Observations', 'Day', 'Conditions Met']
console.log(panelData.index);   // [1, 2, 3, 4]
console.log(panelData.shape);   // [4, 3]
console.log(panelData.dtypes.toArray()); // ['int32', 'object', 'boolean']

// Get a summary of the data
console.log(panelData.info);

// Convert the PanelData back to a regular JavaScript object
console.log(panelData.toJSON);

// Count non-null values in each series
console.log(panelData.countNonNull.toArray()); // [4, 4, 4]
```
