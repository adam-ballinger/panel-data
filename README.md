I'm excited about Node.js and npm. My focus is on writing code that works seamlessly in both Node.js and the browser, with a strong emphasis on creating small, lightweight packages. My goal is to ensure that everything I write is easy to understand, even for beginners, quick to implement, and adheres to best practices and conventions.

I believe in the importance of writing code as human-friendly as possible. I am an amateur with much to learn, I am dedicated to improving my skills and would appreciate any feedback or guidance from the community.
